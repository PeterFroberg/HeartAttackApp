# HeartAttackApp
Purpose of the app was to show a way how it with existing technologies is possible to increase the possibility to get help from 
people around you if you discover a person with a heart failure. The app shows how other persons with the same app should be able to come
to assistens.
The app uses both gps and wifi to find the current location.
